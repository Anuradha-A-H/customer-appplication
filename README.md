1st phase:
1) login is created, 1st time when there is not data fst data is considered as admin (as the question specified only 3 view pages and no hardcoding the credentials so I have added this logic)
2) If login credential is wrong it will throw error else redirect to customer listing page( listing is viewed only my admin)

3) add customer when click of add customer button// it redirect to add customer page and add customer details with customer role by default
4) once added successfully redirect to list customer page with customer credentials or error message(as the question specified only 3 view pages so this add customer page also act add update customer)
